# RAG-Medical-AI-Assistant
I’m building a Medical Assistant chatbot that can answer health questions based on real medical PDFs. It uses a full RAG pipeline with LangChain, Pinecone, Google Embeddings, and Groq’s LLaMA-3 so the answers are accurate, reliable, and grounded in actual medical information rather than generic AI responses —almost like a real medical expert.
